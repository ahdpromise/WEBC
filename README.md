Summary of the Website (https://ahdpromise.github.io/WEBC/)

This project is a frontend-only web application designed to display gas stations in Cologne, Germany. It is hosted using GitHub Pages, meaning the entire application runs client-side (in the browser) without a backend server.

Technologies Used

Frontend:
HTML → Structure of the webpage.
CSS → Styling for layout, colors, and fonts.
JavaScript → Handles dynamic behavior such as sorting, adding new stations, and interacting with stored data.

Backend:
No backend/server → Since it’s a GitHub Pages site, everything is handled in the browser.
Data Handling: Likely uses local storage or a static JSON file to manage gas station data.
